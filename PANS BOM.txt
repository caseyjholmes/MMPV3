NOTES:
Pay close attention to the mixed potentiometer values!! 
You'll need to source some MTS-102 blue switches on ebay and file off the little tab/nubs on the bottom so they sit flush on the PCB
and allow you to acheive panel alignment with the jacks and pots. This is very easy and quick. Almost like cutting off potentiometer tabs.     
You can get these switches in the USA $7 for 20 pieces.
